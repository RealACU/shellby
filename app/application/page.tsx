      <h6 className="text-xl underline">What&apos;s your baby&apos;s name and age?</h6>
      <p>His name is Shellby and as of now he&apos;s four days old.</p>

      <h6 className="pt-3 text-xl underline">
        Is your baby female or male? Which sex chromosomes does your child have?
      </h6>
      <p>Shellby is a boy, so his sex chromosomes are XY.</p>

      <h6 className="pt-3 text-xl underline">
        Name three reflexes your baby has demonstrated in the past and describe
        what your baby did that made you decide it was that type of reflex.
      </h6>
      <ol>
        <li>
          1. Moro reflex, because when there was something scary like Mr.
          Sermeno&apos;s loud air pressure demonstration, Shellby put his arms up.
        </li>
        <li>
          2. Grasping reflex, because Shellby tried to grab little objects next
          to him.
        </li>
        <li>
          3. Rooting reflex, because when I touch his cheek he turns over to
          that side.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h6 className="pt-3 text-xl underline">
        Describe two gender roles your child might learn from growing up in your
        home environment.
      </h6>
      <ol>
        <li>1. Men must &quot;thug it out&quot; and do the hard work.</li>
        <li>2. Women are more suited to be caretakers.</li>
      </ol>

      <h6 className="pt-3 text-xl underline">
        Has your baby developed or gotten over stranger anxiety yet? How do you
        know?
      </h6>
      <p>
        My baby hasn&apos;t developed stranger anxiety yet. I know this because
        whenever he meets another person he doesn&apos;t get scared.
      </p>

      <h6 className="pt-3 text-xl underline">
        What sort of temperament does your baby have? How do you know?
      </h6>
      <p>
        I know that my baby has a social temperament because he likes hanging
        out with other babies. I often noted in my log that Shellby would hang
        out with another baby.
      </p>

      <h6 className="pt-3 text-xl underline">
        What sort of attachment style characterizes your baby? How do you know?
      </h6>
      <p>
        My baby has a secure attachment style because whenever he sees me he
        goes towards me.
      </p>

      <h6 className="pt-3 text-xl underline">
        How do you implement Harry Harlow&apos;s research with your child? If you
        don&apos;t, why not?
      </h6>
      <p>
        Harry Harlow&apos;s research concluded that babies needed physical contact
        for proper development. So, every day I make sure to take Shellby out of
        his container and hold him as I walk around the house.
      </p>

      <h6 className="pt-3 text-xl underline">
        What parenting style do you exercise with your child? Give an example of
        your behavior that would demonstrate your parenting style.
      </h6>
      <p>
        The parenting style I try to use most often is authoritative, where I am
        very supportive of Shellby but also have reasonable demands for him. For
        example, every day I hold him and interact with him, but I stop him from
        leaving his container, which is reasonable.
      </p>

      <h6 className="pt-3 text-xl underline">
        Which stage of cognitive development is your child at? Give an example
        of something your child does that shows they are at that stage.
      </h6>
      <p>
        My child is at the sensorimotor stage. He has not even developed
        stranger anxiety yet, because whenever he meets a new baby he likes to
        interact. He also does not show object permanence because I played
        peek-a-boo with him and he laughed every time.
      </p>

      <h6 className="pt-3 text-xl underline">
        Which stage of psychosocial development is your child at? Describe the
        conflicts being dealt with by your child. What would make them
        successful in that stage that you could do to help?
      </h6>
      <p>
        My child is an infant, so he is at the trust VS mistrust conflict.
        Shellby will trust me if I meet his needs. Otherwise, he will not. So,
        it is very important that I take care of him and fulfill all of his
        needs as an infant.
      </p>

      <h6 className="pt-3 text-xl underline">
        What aspects of your schedule did you change or have to exclude your
        baby from the most? Who did you trust most with your child if you could
        not be around?
      </h6>
      <p>
        I had to get a babysitter whenever I exercised and I also had to add a
        lot of extra time at home taking care of him. Whenever I could not be
        around, I trusted my mom to babysit the most.
      </p>

      <h6 className="pt-3 text-xl underline">
        Would you parent differently from your parents? If so, how? If not, what
        would you keep the same?
      </h6>
      <p>
        I would definitely follow an authoritative parenting style instead of an
        authoritarian one. I would try my best to fulfill my child&apos;s needs while
        also setting reasonable limits. I would also try to explain the limits
        in a way that makes sense to my child.
